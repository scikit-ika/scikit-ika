# DenStream

This a Python implementation of the data stream clustering algorithm "DenStream". The implementation is compatible with scikit-learn and follows the scikit-learn API for clustering algorithms. Details about how the algorithm works can be found in the original paper "Density-Based Clustering over an Evolving Data Stream with Noise", which is available [here](https://archive.siam.org/meetings/sdm06/proceedings/030caof.pdf).
